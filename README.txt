1. Navigate to the movie-search-app folder
2. In terminal type in npm run dev
3. The full url to begin is http://localhost:3000/movie-search

The Backend is found in movie-search-app/webservice, and the front end is everything else.  I am unable to put them in their own specific folder
because the application won't find them if I move them.  The main files that I wrote were:
pages
-movie-search
-search-results

components
-MovieSearch

webservice
-index.js

For future work on this project, It would be productive to filter movies based on their release date, rating, or approval ratings rather than just title.
